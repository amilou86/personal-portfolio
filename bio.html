                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p> With a background in investigations, a passion for creativity, and a drive for
                    continuous improvement, I am eager to transition into the exciting and dynamic field
                    of software engineering. </p>
                <p> My commitment to transitioning into a developer role is unwavering. Despite being a
                    full-time working mum, I am determined to pursue a career in software engineering.
                    This has meant making sacrifices in my personal & home life to dedicate the time
                    needed to complete an intensive bootcamp to gain the skills needed. This career
                    shift is a commitment fuelled by a genuine drive to constantly improve and reach my
                    full potential. I want to be the best version I can be, not only for my own
                    aspirations but also as an example to my daughter. I want to demonstrate that itâ€™s
                    never too late to change and improve yourself and that women belong in, and can
                    thrive in, historically male-dominated industries such as tech and STEM.
                </P>
                <p>My experience in investigations, dealing with complex complaints and tax and
                    insurance fraud, has equipped me with strong logical-analytical abilities. I have
                    skills in objectively evaluating complex information and applying logical deduction
                    to solve challenging intellectual problems. I also have excellent organisational and
                    structural skills. I am adept at handling multiple tasks with precision. I am
                    pragmatic and always aim to work smarter in order to achieve both quality and
                    quantity. I aim to, and will only accept, exceeding all expectations, I am regularly
                    one of, if not the, highest performer on any team.</p>
                <p>Collaboration is a key strength of mine. Balancing patience and assertiveness, I
                    understand others and work effectively with them. This collaborative nature aligns
                    with a team-oriented environment.</p>
